Verse 1:
All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating

Pre-Chorus:
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

Chorus:
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na

Verse 2:
Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

Pre-Chorus:
Just say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

Chorus:
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na

Bridge:
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill

Outro:
